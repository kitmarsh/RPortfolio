# RPortfolio
Summary: R projects I have completed for a biochemistry lab at UST to aid with visualization and analysis of research. 

regression_analysis_git: Rmd meant to act as the hub for all logistic regression visualization processes. The first chunk walked student coworkers through the purposes of the various code components, and all following chunks were for student workers to run experiment-spectific analyses. 

research_analysis_git: Rmd for data visualization via boxplots as well as summary statistics. Sensitive terminology has been replaced with "lab" or redacted altogeher. The first chunk walked student coworkers through the purposes of the various code components, and all following chunks were for student workers to run experiment-spectific analyses.
